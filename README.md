# offline-first-pwa

I started this project to get a better understanding of how to work with and build PWA apps following an offline-first approach. I used a laracast tutorial for building an offline first app using vue CLI:
As vue CLI is in maintenace mode, I decided to follow this tutorial using create-vue to create my app on a more modern stack using vite and vue3.

Goals:
- [] understand how to follow an offline first approach
- [] get a better understanding of how service workers work!
